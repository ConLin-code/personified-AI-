# Personified-AI-
Making an AI with the worldview of specific individuals.

# The purpose
Here I fine-tuned a LLM on data from written texts like books or lectures/speeches from specific individuals. I did this to try and capture the "worldview" of those individuals, and so we can talk to them personally and get their opinion on a given topic; this topic could be something personal to yourself, or something that is happening in the world. 

# What led to me starting this project?
This year I had a difficult decision on which school I should go to, and why, and many times I just wished I could speak to an individual I admired about what his views would be. When walking, I was listening to an old speech from Steve Jobs in which he was talking about asking Aristotle a question and getting a response in his worldview even though he is now deceased(Link here: https://youtu.be/YYjlCrpH2is?si=b4E8nfca0PrKXq1Z). This led to me putting people who I admired into an LLM. How? By fine tuning an existing LLM based on their text/speeches and system prompting the LLM simultaneously. This lead to the cultivation of this project.
